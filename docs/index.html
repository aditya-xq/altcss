            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Over the last few years, I noticed various problems working with CSS.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>I rarely use even 50% of the classes these CSS libraries provide. When I look at the documentation, I see that it is filled with so many things that are irrelevant to me, bloated, and clumsy. Most people do not use most of the features and classes provided in most use cases. It doesn’t affect performance, as unused classes are removed anyway, but it doesn’t feel light with development.</p></li>
                <li><p>I often end up overwriting the CSS or creating my own classes on top of the available ones because, let’s face it — no library is perfect for our own unique contexts. Over time, I see a lot of repetition of work across my projects.</p></li>
            </ol>
